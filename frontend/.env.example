# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values
#
# NOTE: In development, Vite's proxy (vite.config.ts) forwards /api and /socket.io
# to localhost:3000. These env vars are still required but can use localhost.
#
# In production, these URLs must point to the actual backend server.

# Backend API URL (without trailing slash)
# Development: http://localhost:3000/api
# Production:  https://sentinel.example.com/api
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

# WebSocket URL (without trailing slash)
# Development: ws://localhost:3000
# Production:  wss://sentinel.example.com
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000
