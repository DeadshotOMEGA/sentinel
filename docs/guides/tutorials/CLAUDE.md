# CLAUDE Rules: Tutorials

## Scope

Applies when creating documentation in: `docs/guides/tutorials/`

## Non-Negotiables (MUST / MUST NOT)

**Content Type**:

- MUST be learning-oriented step-by-step guides
- MUST teach through practice (NOT reference or how-to)
- MUST include prerequisites and expected outcomes
- MUST use kebab-case filenames

**Structure**:

- MUST include: Introduction, Steps (numbered), Summary, Troubleshooting
- MUST explain concepts along the way (NOT just commands)
- MUST show expected output for each step
- MUST NOT assume advanced knowledge

## Defaults (SHOULD)

**Writing Style**:

- SHOULD be beginner-friendly and explanatory
- SHOULD build confidence with encouraging language
- SHOULD include time estimates

**Organization**:

- SHOULD use simple topic names: `getting-started.md`, `first-repository.md`
- SHOULD link to how-tos for next steps

## Workflow

**When to create tutorial**:

1. New major feature launched
2. Onboarding new developers
3. Users ask "how do I get started with X?"
4. Complex concept needs hands-on introduction

**When NOT to create tutorial**:

- Simple one-step tasks → Use how-to guide
- Looking up specs → Use reference
- Explaining rationale → Use explanation

## Quick Reference

**Template**: `@docs/templates/tutorial.md`

**Characteristics**:

- Learning-oriented (teaches concepts)
- Step-by-step with clear progression
- Safe practice environment
- Beginner-friendly tone
