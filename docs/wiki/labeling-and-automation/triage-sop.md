# Triage SOP

1. Confirm exactly one `type:*` label.
2. Add at least one `area:*` label.
3. Add `priority:*` only if urgency is clear.
4. Keep `status:triage` until scope is clear.
5. If root cause is unclear, add `needs-investigation`.
6. Move to `status:planned` once acceptance and release target are clear.
