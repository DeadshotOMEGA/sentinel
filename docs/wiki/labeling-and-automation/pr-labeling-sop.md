# PR Labeling SOP

1. Verify PR has at least one auto-applied `area:*` label.
2. Add extra `area:*` labels manually if path-based autolabel missed context.
3. Do not require `type:*` on PRs for lean workflow.
4. Resolve merge conflicts quickly; `bot:conflict` should clear automatically once resolved.
