# Local Codex Instructions

This directory uses AGENTS-authored rules.

- Read and follow this `AGENTS.md` before editing files in this directory.
- Treat `MUST`/`MUST NOT` in `AGENTS.md` as mandatory constraints.
- Treat `SHOULD` in `AGENTS.md` as defaults.
- If a deeper subdirectory has its own `AGENTS.md`, the deeper rules win.
